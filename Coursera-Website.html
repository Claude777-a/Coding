        &quot; It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out
        how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could
        have done them better The credit belongs to the man who is
        actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and
        blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and
        again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
        but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
        enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy
        cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
        achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
        while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
        cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;
